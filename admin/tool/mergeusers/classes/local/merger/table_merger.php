/**
 * This interface introduces the concept of table merger: a tool for merging
 * records of the given users to merge.
 *
 * The lifecycle will be:
 *
 * 1. user_merger will call to table_merger.get_tables_to_skip(), to get the list
 *    of tables not to be processed by others table_mergers. This step is done
 *    only once in the configuration phase of the user_merger.
 * 2. user_merger calls to the table_merger.merge() to actually merge records of
 *    the given $tablename. This call will update when necessary the list of
 *    errors (on $errorMessages) and the list of actions performed (on
 *    $actionLog).
 *
 * The goal of the table_merger.get_tables_to_skip() is to exclude from processing
 * specific tables under the control of the current table_merger.
 *
 * Example: Suppose that this table_merger is related to table1, and also
 * to table1_aux, having a direct relation between them. Suppose that
 * this relation makes that actions done in table1 makes certain changes on
 * table1_aux. Therefore, this table_merger can be implemented as follows:
 *
 * a. get_tables_to_skip() returns an array('table1_aux') to exclude that table from being processed
 *    by any other table_merger.
 * b. Invoking merge('table1',...) processes both tables, table1 and
 *    table1_aux according to some specific rules.
